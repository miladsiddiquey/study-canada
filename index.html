            <h2>All you need to know when sending your child to study abroad</h2>
            <p>Honestly, that’s one of the bravest decisions you’ll ever make, and yes, the most crucial one for your child. Studying abroad means your child will come back
                with international exposure and a widened mind-set. As a parent, it is your responsibility to support your child in this decision and also gear up to be a part of
                the process.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="parents_info"> 
            <h2>What do you need to do as a parent?</h2>
            <p>You need to know what motivates your child. As a parent, you should be an active part of their decision-making procedure to ensure they take the right calls in life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="parents_info">
            <h2>Discuss goals openly</h2>
            <p>Sit down and understand why your child wants to go abroad – whether it is career-driven or personal. It is important to know what exactly your child seeks in life to
                be able to guide or support them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="parents_info">
            <h2>Stay informed</h2>
            <p>As a parent take part in researching about the courses your child is interested in, the universities they have been talking about and the kind of lifestyle they would
                most thrive in. This research will also include information on course curriculum, campus life and accommodations options available abroad.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="parents_info">
            <h2>Consider your challenges</h2>
            <p>Reach out to friends and family whose children have gone abroad. Ask them about the challenges you are likely to face and figure out how to deal with them. The
                thumb rule for this is “Be specific as you can” and clear all your doubts before shortlisting any option.</p>
